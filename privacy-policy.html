<h3>Information we collect about you</h3>
We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.<br>
<br>
In Short: We collect a combination of personal data and usage data (how you use the Service). This includes personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address and internet protocol. We also collect information that can be used for advertising purposes, although this information is anonymised, and is not personally identifiable to you as an individual. Methods of collecting data, include tracking cookies, usage data (while you use the service) and pixel data.
<br>
Types of Data Collected
<br>
<h3>Personal Data</h3>
Whilst using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Data”). When you provide personal information through our Service, the information may be sent to servers located in the United Kingdom, and countries around the world. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

If you do so, you authorize us to access certain Gmail account information, such as your public Gmail profile (consistent with your privacy settings in Gmail), your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, relationship interests, current city, previously visited events and locations, and information about and photos of your Gmail friends who might be common Gmail friends with other Blind Tiger users. You will also be asked to allow Blind Tiger to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the Service.

<br><br>
<h3>Tracking Cookies Data</h3>

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity of our Service and hold certain information.
<br>
Cookies are files with small amounts of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalise your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you Blind Tiger advertisements on other sites or applications.
<br>
Pixel tags. We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and Services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
<br>
Information collected by third-parties for advertising purposes. We may allow Service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-anonymised personal information to third parties, and try to ensure that all partners are also GDPR compliant.
<br><br>

<h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>
In Short: The data we collect is used so that we can constantly improve the service, and give every user the best experience possible. We use the data to personalise content to our users, as well as analyse the way in which our users are using the Service. We also use the data so that we’re quickly able to identify any problems with the service. It should also be pointed out, that if you apply for a job with Blind Tiger, we may store your data in the short term while making a decision on your application, but this data will be removed once a decision has been made.

<h3>Transfer of Data</h3>
In Short: The data that you share with us, will be processed inside the United Kingdom, and may therefore travel to servers outside of the country that you live in. We take all steps necessary to make sure that your data is protected while it is being transferred to our servers. By using the service, you are aware that we process our data in the United Kingdom.

<br><br>

<h3>Disclosure of Data</h3>
In Short: When you use Blind Tiger, your public data such as profile photo, name and bio is visible to other members. However, we do not share your personal data outside of the service, unless we are issued with a warrant or similar investigative demand or court order. We believe that the protection and non-disclosure of your data is paramount, so will not share data unless we believe that the safety of the public is at risk. We may however, share non-personal and anonymised information collected, in order to improve the service of both, our partners and our own Service. We also take the protection of data seriously, and have preventative methods and counter-measures to prevent any data breach where possible. You should however take care when clicking on any third-party website within the application, as we’re not able to track their compliance with data protection.
<br>
When you register as a user of Blind Tiger, your Blind Tiger profile will be viewable by other users of the Service. Information viewable by other users of the Service may include your profile photo, your name, and your bio.
<br>
Blind Tiger may disclose your Personal Data on the issuance of a warrant or similar investigative demand, a court order or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or another government agency:
<ul>To comply with a legal obligation</ul>
<ul>To protect and defend the rights or property of Blind Tiger</ul>
<ul>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</ul>
<ul>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</ul>
<ul>To protect against legal liability</ul>
<br>
We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared.
<br>
We may use and share non-personal/anonymised information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with other third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Service and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyse and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for conducting general business analysis or other business purposes.
<br><br>
<h3>Security of Personal Data</h3>

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic service is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We carry out regular reviews on security policies to prevent where possible, any possibility of a data breach.
<br><br>

<br>

Information you provide about yourself while using our Service

Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
<br><br>
